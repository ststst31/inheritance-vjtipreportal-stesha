# VJTI PrepPortal

## Simple Overview
VJTI PrepPortal is a student-driven web platform designed to help students understand placement preparation through shared experiences, peer interaction, and structured placement roadmaps. The platform allows students to post their preparation journey, view previous placement statistics, and explore profiles of other students for guidance and reference.

The main objective of this project is to create a transparent and collaborative environment where students can learn from real placement experiences instead of relying only on scattered information.

## Description
Placement preparation in engineering colleges often depends on informal communication between seniors and juniors. Important information such as interview processes, preparation strategies, and timelines is usually not documented in one place.

VJTI PrepPortal attempts to solve this problem by providing a centralized system where students can share placement experiences, maintain a personal placement roadmap, view previous placement statistics, and learn from peer journeys in a structured manner.

The system is developed as a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The focus of the project is usability, simplicity, and practical application within a college environment.
